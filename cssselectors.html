        <p> When I was younger my family traveled to Italy for Christmas to be with my grandmother. When she passed away, we stopped going but we still like to carry on the traditions of an Italian Christmas here in the States. Here are my tips to have the best Italian-American Christmas. </p>

            <p> I like to decorate ginger bread houses with my family. Here are some Italian Christmas traditions.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In front of St Peters cathedral in Vatican City (see image above), there is a huge Christmas tree put up and many families buy tickets to get entrance to the festive midnight-mass which is held by the Pope.</li>
                <li>There is a festive atmosphere during the whole of December. Christmas markets with various stalls with typical food, Christmas sweets and gifts can be visited in many towns especially in Italy's northern Alto-Adige Region. In the image above you see the Christmas market in Bolzano and the image below shows a popular Christmas market in Rome.</li>
                <li> On 6th of December, many families celebrate St Nicholas Day. Children write letters to St Nicholas asking for gifts and they hang up either a sock or put a plate on the table on Nicholas dayâ€™s eve. Sometimes even a St Nicholas visits the homes of children. Then children sing a Christmas carol or recite a poem.</li>
            </ul>
        <h2 class="subhead"> History </h2>
