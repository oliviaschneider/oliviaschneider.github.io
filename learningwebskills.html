    <p> A couple days after I got back from the fall residency in Vermont I spent a lot of time on websites like <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn" target="_blank"> codeacademy.com </a> and <a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-programming" target="_blank"> khanacademy.com </a> trying to learn basic programming skills. A few years ago I had this weird urge to learn coding, and I bought a book on it and never seriously looked at it, overwhelmed with the amount of foreign looking information within it. But the desire surfaced again, and I wanted to give it another try and see if it could be something I was interested in. 
      <br>
      <br>
      I started watching videos about how to form headlines and paragraphs in HTML that rendered as text we read everyday on websites. For almost a week straight, I returned to the teaching sites and continued with the lessons, adding more skills like how to style the page with color and how to add images and turn them into links. During my "Where are you now?" session, Silas recommended I look at a graphic designer named <a href="http://tracyma.com/"> Tracy Ma </a> and I really like the work she's doing; I found that looking at her work inspired me to continue with the online teaching tools. So to wrap this up, I like programming, and I want to keep doing it, because it gives me confidence knowing that I can learn things the basics quickly, and it feels good knowing that I have some programming knowledge in my tool box.

      Here are some examples of practice projects completed on Codeacademy and Khan Academy.
