  <h1> American Insurance </h1>
<p>
the floor is tiled with blue and beige carpet and it’s horrible
<br>
i imagine each fabric of the carpet absorbing the vocal frustrations from above, 
<br>
saturated with
the exasperated sighs</p>

this is ridiculous
<br>
it’s unbelievable
<br>
it’s a joke

<p> i had to be prompt. be here right at 8 she told me over the phone
otherwise who knows</p>

<p>im here because i’m 26</p>

<p>yesterday i ate ice cream at my parents house
<br>
my house
<br>
mom bought it last week
<br>
a local vanilla
<br>
i ate it all before she had a chance to try some
<br>
but she didn’t even mind
<br>
i normally don’t like vanilla
<br>
and i don’t normally like ice cream she told me
<br>
but egg custard
<br>
this one has egg custard
<br>
and that’s why it’s so good
<br>
i finished it while she was away
<br>
and bought another pint before she came back to replace the first one
<br>
she didn’t seem to notice
<br>
she doesn’t even like ice cream
<br><br></p>

<p>i pulled a clean spoon out of the drawer
<br>
plenty of spoons
<br>
dishwasher freshly emptied
<br>
i love spoon day
<br>
this is how it goes
<br>
i stab at the frozen stuff until i have a small bowl full
<br>
the pieces sweat down the sides of the bowl
<br>
i add chocolate chips to the half frozen soup
<br>
they freeze<br>
i finish
<br>
i get more
<br>
i add more
<br>
they freeze
<br>
am i a child
<br>
this wasn’t yesterday
<br>
i’m making soup at our small table with a tiny spoon
<br>
is my house made of stucco
<br>
is there a big tree outside splitting the house down the middle
<br>
does that tree have a swing
<br>
is the swing broken
<br>
is this me
<br>
split in half
<br>
now broken too<br> </p>

<p>waiting, quiet, i feel sterile
<br>
like i walked through the door and it drenched me in bleach and
<br>
cleansed me of myself
<br>
i had no choice
<br>
yet i still have this skin and this heart and that deep warm thing that mom never likes to talk about</p>

<p>i’m here because i’m 26</p>
