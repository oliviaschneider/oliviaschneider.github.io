  <p> Most of the code was already done for me in these projects, and I just adjusted the elements according to the project objectives in Codecademy, which is where I'm getting these prompts. Following Codecademy directions isn't necessarily a challenge even though I still learn a lot while doing them. It is, however, more of a challenge to translate these projects onto Github for the sake of this site as a personal archive. </p>
    
    <p>This month I learned about Visual Studio Code, a source code editor used to make writing and debugging code easier. Before, I was writing all my code directly in Github, and because the server takes a few minutes to update whenever I commit to a programming change, I found this system frustrating and time consuming. But by writing the HTML and CSS in Visual Studio Code, I can test changes and see them immediately with the creation of an organized filing system for my code projects. When I have the result I want for my cody, I save the files to a folder and upload them to Github. Sometimes I have to change the paths to make sure the links work, but I think I've got the hang of that.
