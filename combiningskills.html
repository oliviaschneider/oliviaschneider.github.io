        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375°. Whisk flour, salt, and baking soda in a small bowl; set aside.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Cook ½ cup (1 stick; 113 g) butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, swirling often and scraping bottom of pan with a heatproof rubber spatula, until butter foams, then browns, about 4 minutes. Transfer butter to a large heatproof bowl and let cool 1 minute. Cut remaining ¼ cup (½ stick; 56 g) butter into small pieces and add to brown butter (it should start to melt but not foam and sizzle, so test with one piece before adding the rest).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once butter is melted, add both sugars and whisk, breaking up any clumps, until sugar is incorporated and no lumps remain. Add egg and egg yolks and whisk until sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds. Whisk in vanilla. Using rubber spatula, fold reserved dry ingredients into butter mixture just until no dry spots remain, then fold in chocolate (the dough will be soft but should hold its shape once scooped; if it slumps or oozes after being scooped, stir dough back together several times and let rest 5–10 minutes until scoops hold their shape as the flour hydrates).
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Using a 1½-oz. scoop (3 Tbsp.), portion out 16 balls of dough and divide between 2 parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets. Bake cookies, rotating sheets if cookies are browning very unevenly (otherwise, just leave them alone), until deep golden brown and firm around the edges, 8–10 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets.
</p>
<p> <em> Cookies can be made 3 days ahead. Store airtight at room temperature. </em> </p>

        <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Beat eggs, pepper, and 1 tsp. salt in a large bowl; set aside.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Pat potatoes dry with a clean towel. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high. Cook potatoes, turning occasionally, until tender, 8–10 minutes (you can cover the skillet in the beginning; the potatoes should be white, not brown). Add onions in batches and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 4–6 minutes. Using a slotted spoon, transfer potato mixture to a rimmed baking sheet and let cool slightly. Strain oil into a heatproof bowl. Wipe out skillet.


</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Beat eggs again until frothy. Add potato mixture to eggs; season with 1 tsp. salt. Heat ¼ cup reserved oil in same skillet over medium-high (chill remaining oil and reserve for another use). Add egg mixture, arranging potatoes to submerge. Reduce heat to medium and continue to cook, making sure potatoes are submerged but mostly undisturbed, until eggs are almost set and top is still slightly runny, 15–20 minutes.
</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Invert tortilla onto a large plate, then slide back into skillet browned side up. Cook over medium heat until golden on the bottom and cooked through, about 5 minutes more.
</p>

<p> <strong> Step 5:</strong> Cut into wedges. Serve warm or at room temperature.</p>

<p> <em> Tortilla can be made 2 hours ahead. Let stand at room temperature. </em> </p>
